<h1>Jackie Chan</h1>
<h2>Jackie Chan, originally Chan Kong-sang, (born April 7, 1954, Hong Kong), is a Hong Kong-born Chinese stuntman, actor, and director whose perilous acrobatic stunts and engaging physical humour made him an action-film star in Asia and helped to bring kung fu movies into the mainstream of American cinema.</h2>
<h2>Chan was born to impoverished parents in Hong Kong. The family moved to Canberra, Australia, when Chan was six, but the following year his parents sent him back to Hong Kong to attend a strict boarding school that trained students for jingxi. From age 7 to 17 he studied acrobatics, singing, martial arts, and mimeâ€”skills that launched him into a position with a professional tumbling troupe and landed him bit roles as a child actor and, later, as a stuntman. </h2>    
<h2>Chan worked both within the Hollywood system (though he disliked the limitations it placed on actors) and in Hong Kong cinema. In the United States he appeared in such films as Shanghai Noon (2000), The Tuxedo (2002), The Forbidden Kingdom (2008), and The Spy Next Door (2010). Chan starred in a remake of the 1984 action-drama The Karate Kid (2010) and later in the revenge thriller The Foreigner (2017). He did voice work in the computer-animated film Kung Fu Panda (2008).</h2>
<h2>In addition to acting, Chan pursued a career in the Hong Kong music industry, releasing a number of original albums beginning in 1984. He founded the Jackie Chan Charitable Organization in 1998, which, among other projects, offers scholarships to Hong Kong youths, and he worked as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF.</h2>
